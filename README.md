# Coursera-Data-Science-Capstone-Project: An analysis of venue types around metro stations in Madrid (Spain)
This repository showcases the final project I did to obtain my final Coursera IBM Data Science Certificate.

In this project we analyze venue-types around metro stations in Madrid (Spain) with the purpose of helping entrepreneurs looking to open a new restaurant in the city. In order to do so, we will use data related to metro stations available under Madrid's City Hall website. Once the data is gathered and cleaned, we will use Foursquare's API to obtain information about venues. Finally, we will use different Python packages for preparing visualizations and applying machine learning concepts such as clustering.
